# The lazy dev

Once upon a time, there was a guy, just a regular guy.
On rainy days, he gamed, on sunny days, he gamed with closed curtains.
While he was living this hermitlike way he discovered that slowly but surely his funds were running out.


He sold every possession he had, the car, the house everything and decided to buy a plane ticket to Tibet. He wanted to be a monk, on his way to the airport he invested all his money in $65K bitcoin. 

On his way to Tibet bitcoin skyrocketed.
When he arrived in Tibet and connected to the local wifi he realized he'd become a millionaire.
Torn between two possible lives he had to choose: the lavish life of a playboy millionaire philantropist, or the sober life of  a spiritual monk

"But why should I choose" he thought.
Just as some people can be programmers and influencers.
He decided his path was to become a millionaire playboy philantropist spiritual monk
