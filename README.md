# The lazy dev

Once upon a time, there was a guy, just a regular guy.
On rainy days, he gamed, on sunny days, he gamed with closed curtains.
While he was living this hermitlike way he discovered that slowly but surely his funds were running out.


He sold every possession he has, the car the house everything and decided to buy a plane ticket to Tibet. He wanted to be a monk, on his way to airport he invested all his money in bitcoin from 65K.
