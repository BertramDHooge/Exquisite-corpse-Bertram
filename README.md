# The lazy dev

Once upon a time, there was a guy, just a regular guy.
On rainy days, he gamed, on sunny days, he gamed with closed curtains.
While he was living this hermitlike way he discovered that slowly but surely his funds were running out.


He sold every possession he has, the car the house everything and decided to buy a plane ticket to Tibet. He wanted to be a monk, on his way to airport he invested all his money in bitcoin from 65K. 

One his way to Tibet the bitcoin skyrocketed.
When he arrived in Tibet and could connect with the local wifi he realized he'd become a millionaire.
Torn between two possible lives he had to choose: The lavish life of a playboy millionaire philantropist, or the sober life of  a spiritual monk

But why choosing he tought.. 
Just as some people can be programmers and influencers
He decided his path was to become a millionaire playboy philantropist spiritual monk
